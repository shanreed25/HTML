# Buttons


## Buttons Types
**Buttons come in three main types, determined by the type attribute of the `<button>` tag or the <`input type="button">` element**

- **Submit**: Used to submit form data to a server when the button is clicked. This is the default behavior if no type is specified when the button is within a <form>. 
- **Reset**: Used to reset the form to its original values. 
- **Button**: A general-purpose button with no default behavior. It requires JavaScript to handle its functionality when clicked.
