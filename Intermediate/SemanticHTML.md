### Semantic HTML
- using appropriate HTML5 elements to convey the meaning and structure of your content, rather than solely for presentation
Examples: <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>.
Benefits include improved accessibility for screen readers and search engine optimization (SEO).
