# HTML: HyperText Markup Language
- **HyperText**: refers to the linking capabilities that allow web pages to connect to other pages or resources via hyperlinks
    - uses these hyperlinks to create a non-linear, interconnected web of information
    - it's how you navigate the web by clicking on links that take you to different locations
    - describes the text that contains links to other text, images, or other resources. These links, often called hyperlinks, are a key feature of HTML and the World Wide Web

- **Markup Language**: uses tags (like <p>, <a>, <img>) to structure and format content on a webpage
    - is a markup language, not a programming language
    - means it's used to structure and format content, rather than to execute instructions or perform calculations
    - tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets
- **Linking**: core of hypertext in HTML is the ability to embed links within the text that, when clicked, take the user to another part of the same page, a different page on the same website, or even a page on a completely different website. 
- **Non-linear Navigation**: unlike traditional linear text, hypertext allows for a non-sequential reading experience
    - users can choose which links to follow, creating a personalized path through the information. 

# HTML
- is the standard markup language for creating web pages
- provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags that tell web browsers how to display text, images, and other multimedia
- web browsers read HTML files and interpret the tags to display the content in a visually appealing - can include text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. 

**While HTML provides the structure, CSS is used to control the visual presentation (styling) of the page, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.**
